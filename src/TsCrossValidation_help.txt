The dataset can be divided into T = R + P where R refers to the training
set used for estimating the parameters of interest. The estimated
coefficients are used to fit the model for the out-of-sample R+h
(h > 0, h < P) observations.
These h-step forecasts are evaluated using some criteria such as e.g.
MAE. Next, extend the training set to R+1, and repeat the steps for
R+1+h as before.

Note: The user-contributed package named "naiveFC" also supports
cross-validating various time-series models. See here:

                               2 = Log Probability Score


Return:
--------
matrix, 2 by nhor matrix showing the cross-validated mean (row 1) and
median (row 2) of the selected evaluation criteria for each horizon
(columns).
